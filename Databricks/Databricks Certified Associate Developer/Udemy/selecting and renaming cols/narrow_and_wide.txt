Narrow Transformation does not result in shuffling (aka row level transformations)

Some functions

df.select
df.filter
df.withColumn
df.withColumnRenamed
df.drop

Wide transformation results in shuffling
For all the wide transformations, we have to deal with group of records based on a key

df.union    (or any set operations)
df.join     (or any join operations)
df.sort or df.OrderBy
df.groupBy
df.distinct
